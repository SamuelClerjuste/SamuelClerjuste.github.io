<h1> About me  </h1>



 


    My name is Samuel Clerjuste, the maestro of melodies, orchestrates symphonies in his ears while navigating the hallowed halls of URI, harmonizing textbooks with tunes!
    <p>
Here are two pictures of me the first picture of me is the first time i ever went skiing i had a great time. I did fall, a lot but I had a lot of fun!!!!

        The second picture is from a super fun hangout with my buddies. It's not every day we all get to catch up, so this was a pretty awesome day filled with laughs and good times. A little snapshot of us just enjoying being together!
